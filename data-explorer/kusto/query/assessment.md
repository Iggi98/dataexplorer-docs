# Kusto Query Language (KQL)

**Kusto Query Language (KQL)** is a powerful and flexible tool for analyzing data. It enables users to **explore data**, **discover patterns**, **identify anomalies**, and **create statistical models** with ease. KQL is widely used for querying telemetry, logs, metrics, and other structured or semi-structured data sources. Its syntax is expressive, easy to read, and optimized for both authoring and analysis experiences.

KQL supports advanced operations like:
- **Text search and parsing**
- **Time-series analytics**
- **Aggregation and filtering**
- **Geospatial operations**
- **Vector similarity searches**

Queries in KQL operate on **schema entities** organized hierarchically into databases, tables, and columnsâ€”much like SQL.

## **Getting Started with KQL**

This article explains Kusto Query Language concepts, providing examples and exercises to help you begin writing queries. To explore KQL interactively:
- Use the [Azure Data Explorer web UI](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/)
- For a practical guide, visit [Tutorial: Learn common operators](tutorials/learn-common-operators.md)

## Key Concepts of KQL

### Tabular Expression Statements

The most common query type in KQL is the **tabular expression statement**, where input and output data are represented as **tables** (or tabular datasets). A query consists of **operators** chained together using the **pipe symbol (`|`)**, which streams data sequentially through transformations.

Here's an example:

```kusto
StormEvents
| where StartTime between (datetime(2007-11-01) .. datetime(2007-12-01))
| where State == "florida"  
| count
```
**Explanation**:
1. **StormEvents**: The table being queried.
2. **`where` operator**: Filters rows based on conditions.
3. **`|` (pipe)**: Streams filtered data to the next step.
4. **`count` operator**: Returns the count of filtered rows.

**Result**:
```
Count
28
```
> **Note**: KQL is **case-sensitive** for table names, column names, operators, and functions.

### Types of Query Statements

KQL queries consist of **one or more query statements**, which are always separated by a semicolon (`;`). There are three main types:

1. **Tabular Expression Statement**: Processes and returns tabular data.
2. **Let Statement**: Defines variables for temporary use.
3. **Set Statement**: Configures query settings.

For detailed examples, refer to [Application query statements](statements.md#application-query-statements).

## Management Commands

Management commands differ from KQL queries. While queries **read data**, management commands **modify** or **retrieve metadata**. They are executed using a **dot (`.`)** prefix for enhanced security.

**Example:** Create a new table called "Logs" with two columns:

```kusto
.create table Logs (Level:string, Text:string)
```

- **`.create`**: Creates or modifies schema objects.
- **`.show`**: Retrieves metadata or information.

Example to display all tables in a database:
```kusto
.show tables
```

## **KQL in Microsoft Services**

KQL is integrated across various Microsoft services to facilitate data querying and analysis. For specific information on the use of KQL in these environments, refer to the following links:
